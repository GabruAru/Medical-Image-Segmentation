Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a type of endoscopic procedure that allows physicians to examine the digestive system by inserting a long, flexible lighted instrument called an endoscope either through the rectum or down through the throat.
A polyp is a projecting growth of tissue from a surface in the body, usually a mucous membrane. Bowel polyps are not usually cancerous, although if they're discovered they'll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated.
